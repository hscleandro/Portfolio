## Overview
In this document, I aim to provide a compilation of the key public projects I have been developing in recent years. By sharing these projects, my objective is to showcase practical work in the field of analytics and foster collaborations that can enhance my professional growth. Furthermore, I aspire to inspire and motivate potential collaborators to explore new possibilities in the realm of data analysis.

If any of these projects pique your interest or if you have ideas for new initiatives, improvements, suggestions, and so on, please do not hesitate to get in touch. I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and continuously seek ways to expand my network and contribute to the advancement of the analytics field.
