## Projects

### Sentiment analysis on Twitter using Apache streaming

#### Business Problem:
To create a proof of concept for evaluating the behavior of terms or keywords related to a specific aspect of a product within the Twitter social media platform. During the development phase, the stakeholder was involved in promoting a product within a Brazilian television show, and Twitter served as the primary feedback channel for the marketing team to assess the product's reception in an open environment. The evaluation process was conducted manually, with marketing professionals monitoring Twitter during the product's airing on the show (during evening and late-night hours), using intuitive judgment to gauge the brand's impression.

#### Proposed Solution:
To develop a real-time data analysis tool with an embedded sentiment classifier that can retrieve posts related to specific keywords and provide sentiment analysis for each post with a known accuracy margin. The tool aims to streamline the process of monitoring and evaluating public sentiment on Twitter, enabling the marketing team to gain actionable insights into the brand's perception and acceptance during the program's broadcast.
